I'll begin writing seriously from new year. The plan is to complete one chapter per month. I am planning to have 25 chapters, so the book will be completed in 25 months. That is Feb 2019. This makes sense. I can then review the book, refactor it and do all necessory work. Finally first release will be on the Chrismas Eve on 2019. By that time, the content of the book will also make sense to the people as people will become more intelligent. LOL :)
