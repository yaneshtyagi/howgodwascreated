Simple Markdown Tutorial

# Chapter Title

To start a new chapter, use # followed by the chapter title on a line by itself, like this.

## Section Title

Double hash makes a section.

**Bold**

Surround your text with double astrick on each side to make it bold.

*italics*

single astrick surrondings make it italics.

You need a markdown editor to view how it exactly looks like.
