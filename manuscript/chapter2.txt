# Chapter 2

It was a **bold** and *italic* night!

Suddenly, a shot rang out! There was a big blast. Rahul could see nothing but smoke. 

"There is smoke so there must be fire as well." He thought. And he was right. There was fire. 
He could see it now. Although he was not able see the fire directly but he could feel the reddishness
in the environment.

Rahul celebrated his 25th birthday last week. It was a simple celebration. Only a few friends and close
family was invited. His three kids and two wives were very happy. His friend Ron camw with his
long time girlfriend Zoba. Zoba was pregnant so she was lying on the makeshift wooden chair for 
most of the time.

Julie also came with her husband Sorovasky and boyfriend Romanji. Polygamy and polyandry was a common
practice in the clan. Marriage was just a symbolic tradition. Practically a few people begin living
together and they call it family. A man or a women can lead the family. The leader of the family
can have marriage-like relations with one or more people of opposite sex. same sex relations are 
considered as biggest crime. And the punishment is death of both. People can have sexual relation
with anyone barring close blood relationsships of self or partner.

Kids are considered as common family asset and common asset of the clan by extension.
